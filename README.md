This is the repo for my portfolio, available at [gianluparri03.github.io](https://gianluparri03.github.io).
I used a [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon in it.

It supports multiple color schemes, if you want to add one just make a pull request and edit the first lines of [color_schemes.js](color_schemes.js)
to add it _(every element of `schemes` is a color scheme, represented by the background color, the texts color and the links color, in this order)_.
