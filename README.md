# gianluparri03.github.io

This is the repo for my portfolio, available at [gianluparri03.github.io](https://gianluparri03.github.io).

The [project section](https://gianluparri03.github.io/projects.html) automatically fetches and parses the projects from [a GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/gianluparri03/d3ed8d776078554b37c77687aec54010), so I don't have to make a commit every time.

For this website I used [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/), a monospace font from [Source Foundry](https://sourcefoundry.org).
