# New Portfolio

In this repo you can see the source code for my future new portfolio (today it's available at [gianluparri03.github.io/new_portfolio](https://gianluparri03.github.io/new_portfolio)) that I created for my own.

### Fonts and Icons

For this project I used:
- Icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- Fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) ([Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) and [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro))

### Colors

That's just a place where I write all the colors used. It's quite useless.
