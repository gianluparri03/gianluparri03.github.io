In this repo you can see the source code for my future new portfolio (available at [gianluparri03.github.io](https://gianluparri03.github.io) that I created for my own.

For this project I used [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/), a monospace font from [Source Foundry](https://sourcefoundry.org)
