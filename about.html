	<main>
		Hi. <br>
		I'm Gianluca Parri, an Italian 16 y.o.learning developer.<br><br>

		<b>Programming Languages</b><br>
		My main programming languages are Python and Go.<br>
		I like ruby, but I'm not using it in anywhere and I'm not so good at it.<br>
		I know a bit of SQL, HTML, CSS, JS and C++ (from Arduino), but I don't use them so much.<br><br>

		<b>Developing</b><br>
		I really enjoy writing REST APIs, or working with http in general.<br>
		All the APIs I've written works Flask (for python) or Mux (for golang).<br>
		Oh, I've also designed some GUI for desktop with PyQt, but honestly they weren't so nice.<br>
		Well, I had fun doing them.<br><br>

		<b>Other</b><br>
		Well, I like sci-fi and fantasy films and books.<br>
		I really enjoy MCU's films and Harry Potter's ones (I haven't read the books yet).<br>
		I read also a lot of books, most of which written by Michael Crichton or Rick Riordan.
